# Vertical Slicing Examples

## Core Principle

Every phase is a vertical slice that delivers independently demoable functionality. Phases touch all necessary layers (DB, service, API, UI) for one piece of end-to-end behavior.

**The question each phase must answer:** "What can the user DO after this phase is complete?"

## Example 1: CRUD API (Blog Posts)

### Context

```yaml
Feature: Blog Post Management
Layers: Database, API, Frontend
Risk level: Low
```

### Breakdown (5 phases)

```
Phase 1: Create a blog post
  Tasks:
  - Add posts table migration (DB)
    Unit tests: migration applies, rolls back, columns correct
  - Implement Post model with validations (Service)
    Unit tests: test_create_post_valid, test_title_required, test_body_required
  - Implement POST /api/posts endpoint (API)
    Unit tests: test_create_post_201, test_create_missing_title_422, test_create_empty_body_422
  - Create PostForm component (UI)
    Unit tests: test_renders_fields, test_validates_required, test_submits_data
  - Wire form submission to API (Integration)
    Unit tests: test_submit_calls_api, test_shows_success, test_shows_error
  Demoable: User can create a blog post via the form
  E2E acceptance: POST valid data -> 201; form submit -> post appears in DB; validation errors shown

Phase 2: List blog posts
  Tasks:
  - Implement GET /api/posts with pagination (API)
    Unit tests: test_list_returns_posts, test_pagination_limit_offset, test_empty_list_200
  - Create PostList component with loading states (UI)
    Unit tests: test_renders_posts, test_loading_state, test_empty_state
  - Add empty state and pagination controls (UI)
    Unit tests: test_next_page_button, test_disabled_on_last_page
  Demoable: User sees paginated list of all posts

    Unit tests: test_edit_button_visible, test_edit_navigates_to_form
  Demoable: User can edit an existing post
  E2E acceptance: Edit button -> form prefilled -> submit -> updated post displayed

Phase 5: Delete a blog post
  Tasks:
  - Implement DELETE /api/posts/:id endpoint (API)
    Unit tests: test_delete_post_204, test_delete_nonexistent_404
  - Add delete button with confirmation dialog (UI)

  - Handle post-delete redirect to list (UI)
    Unit tests: test_redirects_after_delete
  Demoable: User can delete a post with confirmation

## Summary

**Every phase answers:** "What can the user DO after this?"

**Vertical slicing principles:**
- Phase 1 is always the thinnest end-to-end slice (walking skeleton)
- Subsequent phases add functionality, not layers
- Each phase is independently demoable
- Tasks within a phase are atomic todos (hours, not days)
- Dependencies between phases are explicit
- Tasks within a phase can note parallelisation opportunities
